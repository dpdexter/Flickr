* SETTING UP A WYGWAM BUTTON*
1: Be sure EE Hive Flickr is installed and configured correctly
2. Be sure to copy the /themes/third_party/wygwam/lib/ckeditor/plugins/flickr folder into the correct place within the wygwam themes folder (keep note of this if you are updating wygwam in the future)
3: Go to Modules > Wygwam and select a Editor Configuration to modify
4. Be sure that your toolbar includes the "Image" button and that it is active
5. Under the Advanced Settings, add a new row; select "extraPlugins" in the dropdown, and enter "flickr" into the text field
6. Save changes. Now your custom field that is using that wygwam toolbar configuration should have a Flickr button!
